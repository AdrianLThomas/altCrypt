# altCrypt
Local file symmetric encryption/decryption library for .NET

This is currently in alpha. Breaking changes will be ongoing.

The library can be used in your own applications.
Or you can use the command line utility to encrypt your files manually.
GUI's are a work in progress.

It currently only supports the full version of .NET but a WinRT / Universal solution is in the pipeline.
